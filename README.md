# SwiftKey-Word-Prediction
The aim of this project is to predict the next word when a set of keywords are given. This is a Capstone Project provided by John Hopkins University in Coursera as a part of Data Science Specialization. 

The code for this can be found in the following files:
* [Model.R](https://github.com/teja876/SwiftKey-Word-Prediction/blob/master/Model.R) for the model.
* [predict.R](https://github.com/teja876/SwiftKey-Word-Prediction/blob/master/predict.R) to predict
* [Server.R](https://github.com/teja876/SwiftKey-Word-Prediction/blob/master/server.R) for server part of Shiny App
* [UI.R](https://github.com/teja876/SwiftKey-Word-Prediction/blob/master/ui.R) for the User Interface part of Shiny App.

The explaination of the whole model can be found in the following files:
* [Milestone Report](http://rpubs.com/SaiTeja/Milestone_Report) which explains the Data Cleaning, Data Pre-Processing.
* [PitchPresentation](http://rpubs.com/SaiTeja/WordPrediction) is the presentation that explains the whole working.

You can find the Shiny App here : https://myfirstshinyapp1.shinyapps.io/WordPrediction/ .

This might take a couple of seconds to load the Application.
